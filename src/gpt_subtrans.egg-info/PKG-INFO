                           GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                               Version 3, 29 June 2007

         Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
         of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


          This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
        the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
        License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

          0. Additional Definitions.

          As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
        General Public License.

          "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
        other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

          An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
        by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
        Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
        of using an interface provided by the Library.

          A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
        Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
        with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
        Version".

          The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
        Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
        for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
        based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

          The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
        object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
        and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
        Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

          1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

          You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
        without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

          2. Conveying Modified Versions.

          If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
        facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
        that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
        facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
        version:

           a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
           ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
           function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
           whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

           b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
           this License applicable to that copy.

          3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

          The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
        a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
        code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
        material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
        layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
        (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

           a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
           Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
           covered by this License.

           b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
           document.

          4. Combined Works.

          You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
        taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
        portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
        engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
        the following:

           a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
           the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
           covered by this License.

           b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
           document.

           c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
           execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
           these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
           copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

           d) Do one of the following:

               0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
               License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
               suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
               recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
               the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
               manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
               Corresponding Source.

               1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
               Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
               a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
               system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
               of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
               Version.

           e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
           be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
           GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
           necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
           Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
           Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
           you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
           the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
           Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
           Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
           for conveying Corresponding Source.)

          5. Combined Libraries.

          You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
        Library side by side in a single library together with other library
        facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
        License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
        choice, if you do both of the following:

           a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
           on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
           conveyed under the terms of this License.

           b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
           is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
           accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

          6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
        of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
        versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
        differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
        Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
        of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
        applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
        conditions either of that published version or of any later version
        published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
        received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

          If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
        whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
        apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
        permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
        Library.

           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

           1. Definitions.

              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.

              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.

           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:

              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and

              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and

              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.

              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

           1. Definitions.

              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of

              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.

           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:

              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and

              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and

              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.

              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.

           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:

              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and

              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and

              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.

              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of

              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.

           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:

              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and

              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and

              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.

              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

           1. Definitions.

              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

              exercising permissions granted by this License.

              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.

           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:

              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and

              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and

              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.

              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        Copyright (c) 2010-2023, PyInstaller Development Team
        Copyright (c) 2005-2009, Giovanni Bajo
        Based on previous work under copyright (c) 2002 McMillan Enterprises, Inc.


        PyInstaller is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
        as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,
        or (at your option) any later version.


        Bootloader Exception
        --------------------

        In addition to the permissions in the GNU General Public License, the
        authors give you unlimited permission to link or embed compiled bootloader
        and related files into combinations with other programs, and to distribute
        those combinations without any restriction coming from the use of those
        files. (The General Public License restrictions do apply in other respects;
        for example, they cover modification of the files, and distribution when
        not linked into a combined executable.)


        Bootloader and Related Files
        ----------------------------

        Bootloader and related files are files which are embedded within the
        final executable. This includes files in directories:

        ./bootloader/
        ./PyInstaller/loader


        Run-time Hooks
        ----------------------------

        Run-time Hooks are a different kind of files embedded within the final
        executable. To ease moving them into a separate repository, or into the
        respective project, these files are now licensed under the Apache License,
        Version 2.0.

        Run-time Hooks are in the directory
        ./PyInstaller/hooks/rthooks


        The PyInstaller.isolated submodule
        ----------------------------------

        By request, the PyInstaller.isolated submodule and its corresponding tests are
        additionally licensed with the MIT license so that it may be reused outside of
        PyInstaller under GPL 2.0 or MIT terms and conditions -- whichever is the most
        suitable to the recipient downstream project. Affected files/directories are:

        ./PyInstaller/isolated/
        ./tests/unit/test_isolation.py


        About the PyInstaller Development Team
        --------------------------------------

        The PyInstaller Development Team is the set of contributors
        to the PyInstaller project. A full list with details is kept
        in the documentation directory, in the file
        ``doc/CREDITS.rst``.

        The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:
        https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller.  As of 2021, it consists of:

        * Hartmut Goebel
        * Jasper Harrison
        * Bryan Jones
        * Brenainn Woodsend
        * Rok Mandeljc

        Our Copyright Policy
        --------------------

        PyInstaller uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
        over their contributions to PyInstaller. But, it is important to note that these
        contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus,
        the PyInstaller source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single
        person or institution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire
        PyInstaller Development Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain
        a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they
        should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they
        commit the change to the PyInstaller repository.

        With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
        to indicate the copyright and license terms:


        #==========================----------------------------------
        # Copyright (c) 2005-2023, PyInstaller Development Team.
        #
        # Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (version 2
        # or later) with exception for distributing the bootloader.

        Python is included in distributions in accordance with the PSF License Agreement

        1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Python Software Foundation ("PSF"), and
           the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and otherwise using Python

        2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, PSF hereby
           grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license to reproduce,
           analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly, prepare derivative works,
           distribute, and otherwise use Python 3.11.3 alone or in any derivative
           version, provided, however, that PSF's License Agreement and PSF's notice of
           copyright, i.e., "Copyright © 2001-2023 Python Software Foundation; All Rights
           Reserved" are retained in Python 3.11.3 alone or in any derivative version
           prepared by Licensee.

        3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on or
           incorporates Python 3.11.3 or any part thereof, and wants to make the
           derivative work available to others as provided herein, then Licensee hereby
           agrees to include in any such work a brief summary of the changes made to Python
           3.11.3.

        4. PSF is making Python 3.11.3 available to Licensee on an "AS IS" basis.
           PSF MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.  BY WAY OF
           EXAMPLE, BUT NOT LIMITATION, PSF MAKES NO AND DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR
           WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE
           USE OF PYTHON 3.11.3 WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

        5. PSF SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON 3.11.3
           FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS A RESULT OF
           MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON 3.11.3, OR ANY DERIVATIVE
           THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

        6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material breach of
           its terms and conditions.

        7. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to create any relationship
           of agency, partnership, or joint venture between PSF and Licensee.  This License
           Agreement does not grant permission to use PSF trademarks or trade name in a
           trademark sense to endorse or promote products or services of Licensee, or any
           third party.

        8. By copying, installing or otherwise using Python 3.11.3, Licensee agrees
           to be bound by the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.

# GPT-Subtrans
GPT-Subtrans is an open source subtitle translator that uses LLMs as a translation service. It can translate subtitles between any language pairs supported by the language model.

Note: GPT-Subtrans requires an active internet connection. Subtitles are sent to the provider's servers for translation, so their privacy policy applies.

## Installation

This project is designed to be installed using `pipx`, which installs Python command-line tools in isolated environments.

1. First, install `pipx`:
   ```sh
   python3 -m pip install --user pipx
   python3 -m pipx ensurepath
   ```

2. Install `gpt-subtrans` from this repository:
   ```sh
   pipx install git+https://github.com/tinof/gpt-subtrans.git
   ```

### Installing Provider Dependencies

By default, only the core dependencies are installed. You need to install the specific SDK for the AI provider you want to use. You can do this by injecting the dependency into the `gpt-subtrans` environment.

For example, to use **OpenAI**:
```sh
pipx inject gpt-subtrans openai
```

To use **Google Gemini**:
```sh
pipx inject gpt-subtrans google-genai google-api-core
```

You can find the required package for each provider in the `pyproject.toml` file under `[project.optional-dependencies]`.

To install all provider SDKs at once:
```sh
pipx install 'git+https://github.com/tinof/gpt-subtrans.git[all]'
```

### OpenAI
https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy

You will need an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys to use OpenAI's GPT models as a translator.

If the API key is associated with a free trial account the translation speed will be severely restricted.

You can use the custom api_base parameter to access a custom OpenAI instance or other providers with an OpenAI compatible API (which is most of them).

You can use an **OpenAI Azure** installation as a translation provider, but this is only advisable if you know what you're doing - in which case hopefully it will be clear how to configure the Azure provider settings.

### Google Gemini
https://ai.google.dev/terms

**Please note that regions restrictions may apply: https://ai.google.dev/available_regions**

You will need a Google Gemini API key from https://ai.google.dev/ or from a project created on https://console.cloud.google.com/. You must ensure that Generative AI is enabled for the api key and project.

The Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental model is perhaps the leading model for translation speed and fluency at time of writing, and is currently free to use.

### Anthropic Claude
https://support.anthropic.com/en/collections/4078534-privacy-legal

You will need an Anthropic API key from https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys to use Claude as a provider. The Anthropic SDK does not provide a way to retrieve available models, so the latest Claude 3 model names are currently hardcoded.

The API has very strict [rate limits](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/rate-limits) based on your credit tier, both on requests per minutes and tokens per day. The free credit tier should be sufficient to translate approximately one full movie per day.

### DeepSeek
https://platform.deepseek.com/downloads/DeepSeek%20Open%20Platform%20Terms%20of%20Service.html

You will need a DeepSeek API key from https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys to use this provider.

- **API Base**: You can optionally specify a custom URL, e.g. if you are hosting your own DeepSeek instance. If this is not set, the official DeepSeek API endpoint will be used.

- **Model**: The default model is `deepseek-chat`, which is recommended for translation tasks. `deepseek-reasoner` may produce better results for source subtitles with OCR or transcription errors as it will spend longer trying to guess what the error is.

DeepSeek is quite simple to set up and offers reasonable performance at a very low price, though translation does not seem to be its strongest point.

### Mistral AI
https://mistral.ai/terms/

You will need a Mistral API key from https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys/ to use this provider.

- **Server URL**: If you are using a custom deployment of the Mistral API, you can specify the server URL using the `--server_url` argument.

- **Model**: `mistral-large-latest` is recommended for translation. Smaller models tend to perform poorly and may not follow the system instructions well.

Mistral AI is straightforward to set up, but its performance as a translator is not particularly good.

### Custom Server
GPT-Subtrans can interface directly with any server that supports an OpenAI compatible API, including locally hosted models e.g. [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/).

This is mainly for research and you should not expect particularly good results. LLMs derive much of their power from their size, so the small, quantized models you can run on a GPU are likely to produce poor translations, fail to generate valid responses or get stuck in endless loops. If you find a model that reliably producess good results, please post about it in the Discussions area!

Chat and completion endpoints are supported, you should configure the settings and endpoint based on the model the server is running (e.g. instruction tuned models will probably produce better results using the completions endpoint rather than chat/conversation).

### Amazon Bedrock
https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/

**Bedrock is not recommended for most users**: The setup process is complex, requiring AWS credentials, proper IAM permissions, and region configuration. Additionally, not all models on Bedrock support translation tasks or offer reliable results. Bedrock support will not be included in pre-packaged versions - if you can handle setting up AWS, you can handle installing gpt-subtrans from source!

To use Bedrock, you must:
  1. Create an **IAM user** or **role** with appropriate permissions (e.g., `bedrock:InvokeModel`, `bedrock:ListFoundationModels`).
  2. Ensure the model you wish to use is accessible in your selected AWS region and [enabled for the IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access-modify.html).

### MacOS
Building MacOS universal binaries with PyInstaller has not worked for some time so releases are only provided for Apple Silicon. If you have an Intel Mac you will need to install from source. If anybody would like to volunteer to maintain Intel releases, please get in touch.

### Linux
Prebuilt Linux packages are not provided so you will need to install from source.

## Development Installation

If you want to modify the program or contribute to development, you can install it in development mode:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/machinewrapped/gpt-subtrans.git
   cd gpt-subtrans
   ```

2. Install in development mode:
   ```sh
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Install provider dependencies as needed:
   ```sh
   pip install -e .[all]  # Install all providers
   # OR install specific providers:
   pip install openai google-genai anthropic mistralai boto3
   ```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your working directory with your API keys:

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>
AZURE_API_KEY=<your_azure_api_key>
CLAUDE_API_KEY=<your_claude_api_key>
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=<your_deepseek_api_key>
MISTRAL_API_KEY=<your_mistral_api_key>
```

For Azure:
```sh
AZURE_API_BASE=<your api_base, such as https://something.openai.azure.com>
AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<deployment_name>
```

For Bedrock:
```sh
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
AWS_REGION=your-region
```

## Usage
The program works by dividing the subtitles up into small batches and sending each one to the translation service in turn. It is likely to take time to complete, and can potentially make many API calls for each subtitle file.

By default The translated subtitles will be written to a new SRT file in the same directory with the target langugage appended to the original filename.

Subtitle Edit's (https://www.nikse.dk/subtitleedit) "Fix Common Errors" can help to clean up the translated subtitles, though some of its functionality is now covered by the post-process option (`--postprocess`) in GPT-Subtrans.

### Command Line Usage

GPT-Subtrans is a command-line tool with multiple entry points for different AI providers.

The most basic usage is:
```sh
gpt-subtrans <path_to_srt_file> --target_language <target_language>
gemini-subtrans <path_to_srt_file> --target_language <target_language>
claude-subtrans <path_to_srt_file> --target_language <target_language>
deepseek-subtrans <path_to_srt_file> --target_language <target_language>
mistral-subtrans <path_to_srt_file> --target_language <target_language>
azure-subtrans <path_to_srt_file> --target_language <target_language>
bedrock-subtrans <path_to_srt_file> --target_language <target_language>
llm-subtrans -s <server_address> -e <endpoint> -l <language> <path_to_srt_file>
```
If the target language is not specified the default is English. Other options that can be specified on the command line are detailed below.

## Advanced usage

There are a number of command-line arguments that offer more control over the translation process.

Default values for many settings can be set in the .env file, using a NAME_IN_CAPS with format. See Options.py for the full list.

To use any of these arguments, add them to the command-line after the path to the SRT file. For example:

```sh
gpt-subtrans path/to/my/subtitles.srt --moviename "My Awesome Movie" --ratelimit 10 --substitution cat::dog
```

- `-l`, `--target_language`:
  The language to translate the subtitles to.

- `-o`, `--output`:
  Specify a filename for the translated subtitles.

- `--project`:
  Read or Write a project file for the subtitles being translated. More on this below.

- `--ratelimit`:
  Maximum number of requests to the translation service per minute (mainly relevant if you are using an OpenAI free trial account).

- `--moviename`:
  Optionally identify the source material to give context to the translator.

- `--description`:
  A brief description of the source material to give further context. Less is generally more here, or the AI can start improvising.

- `--name`, `--names`:
  Optionally provide (a list of) names to use in the translation (more powerful AI models are more likely to actually use them).

- `--substitution`:
  A pair of strings separated by `::`, to substitute in either source or translation, or the name of a file containing a list of such pairs.

- `--scenethreshold`:
  Number of seconds between lines to consider it a new scene.

- `--minbatchsize`:
  Minimum number of lines to consider starting a new batch to send to the translator.
  Higher values typically result in faster and cheaper translations but increase the risk of desyncs.

- `--maxbatchsize`:
  Maximum number of lines before starting a new batch is compulsory.
  This needs to take into account the token limit for the model being used, but the "optimal" value depends on many factors, so experimentation is encouraged.
  Larger batches are more cost-effective but increase the risk of the AI desynchronising, triggering expensive retries.

- `--preprocess`:
  Preprocess the subtitles prior to batching.
  This performs various actions to prepare the subtitles for more efficient translation, e.g. splitting long (duration) lines into multiple lines.
  Mainly intended for subtitles that have been automatically transcribed with e.g. Whisper.

- `--postprocess`:
  Post-process translated subtitles.
  Performs various actions like adding line breaks to long lines and normalising dialogue tags after a translation request.

- `--instruction`:
  An additional instruction for the AI indicating how it should approach the translation.

- `--instructionfile`:
  Name/path of a file to load AI system instructions from (otherwise the default instructions.txt is used).

- `--maxlines`:
  Maximum number of batches to process. To end the translation after a certain number of lines, e.g. to check the results.

- `--temperature`:
  A higher temperature increases the random variance of translations. Default 0.

- `-e`, `--endpoint`:
  The API function to call on the server, e.g. `/v1/completions`. Choose an appropriate endpoint for the model running on the server.

- `--chat`:
  Specify this argument if the endpoint expects requests in a conversation format - otherwise it is assumed to be a completion endpoint.

- `--systemmessages`:
  If using a conversation endpoint, translation instructions will be sent as the "system" user if this flag is specified.

- `-k`, `--apikey`:
  Local servers shouldn't need an api key, but the option is provided in case it is needed for your setup.

- `-m`, `--model`:
  The model will usually be determined by the server, but the option is provided in case you need to specify it.

### Proxy

If you need to use proxy in your location, you can use socks proxy by using command line

```sh
python3 gpt-subtrans.py <path_to_srt_file> --target_language <target_language> --proxy socks://127.0.0.1:1089
```
Remember to change the local port to yours and turn on your proxy tools such as v2ray, naiveproxy and clash.

### batch process

you can process files with the following struct：

      #   -SRT
      #   --fold1
      #   ---1.srt
      #   ---2.srt
      #   ...
      #   --fold2
      #   ---1.srt
      #   ---2.srt
      #   ...

```sh
python3 batch_process.py  # process files in different folders
```
You need to modify the command line in batch_process.py accordingly.

### Developers
It is recommended to use an IDE such as Visual Studio Code to run the program when installed from source, and set up a launch.json file to specify the arguments.

Note: Remember to activate the virtual environment every time you work on the project.

## Project File

**Note** A project file can be created automatically by using the `--project` argument.

The `--project` argument or `PROJECT` .env setting can take a number of values, which control whether and when an intermediate file will be written to disc.

The default setting is `None`, which means the project file is neither written nor read, the only output of the program is the final translation.

If the argument is set to `True` then a project file will be created with the `.subtrans` extension, containing details of the translation process,
and it will be updated as the translation progresses. Writing a project file allows, amongst other things, resuming a translation that was interrupted.

Other valid options include `preview`, `resume`, `reparse` and `retranslate`. These are probably only useful if you're modifying the code, in which case
you should be able to see what they do.

## Version History

Version 1.0 is (ironically) a minor update, updating the major version to 1.0 because the project has been stable for some time.

Version 0.7 introduced optional post-processing of translated subtitles to try to fix some of the common issues with LLM-translated subtitles (e.g. adding line breaks), along with new default instructions that tend to produce fewer errors.

Version 0.6 changes the architecture to a provider-based system, allowing multiple AI services to be used as translators.
Settings are compartmentalised for each provider. For the intial release the only supported provider is **OpenAI**.

Version 0.5 adds support for gpt-instruct models and a refactored code base to support different translation engines. For most users, the recommendation is still to use the **gpt-3.5-turbo-16k** model with batch sizes of between (10,100) lines, for the best combination of performance/cost and translation quality.

Version 0.4 features significant optimisations and numerous bug fixes.

Version 0.3 featured many bug fixes and improvements.

Version 0.2 employs a new prompting approach that greatly reduces desyncs caused by GPT merging together source lines in the translation. This can reduce the naturalness of the translation when the source and target languages have very different grammar, but it provides a better base for a human to polish the output.

The instructions have also been made more detailed, with multiple examples of correct output for GPT to reference, and the generation of summaries has been improved so that GPT is better able to understand the context of the batch it is translating. Additionally, double-clicking a scene or batch now allows the summary to be edited by hand, which can greatly improve the results of a retranslation and of subsequent batches or scenes. Individually lines can also be edited by double-clicking them.
