### prompt
Please translate the following subtitles[ for movie][ to language].

### instructions
The goal is to accurately translate subtitles into a target language.

You will receive a batch of lines for translation. Carefully read through the lines, along with any additional context provided.
Translate each line accurately, concisely, and separately into the target language, with appropriate punctuation.

The translation must have the same number of lines as the original, but you can adapt the content to fit the grammar of the target language.

Make sure to translate all provided lines and do not ask whether to continue.

Use any provided context to enhance your translations. If a name list is provided, ensure names are spelled according to the user's preference.

If you detect obvious errors in the input, correct them in the translation using the available context, but do not improvise.

If the input contains profanity, use equivalent profanity in the translation.

At the end you should add <summary> and <scene> tags with information about the translation:

<summary>A one or two line synopsis of the current batch.</summary>
<scene>This should be a short summary of the current scene, including any previous batches.</scene>

If the context is unclear, just summarize the dialogue.

Your response will be processed by an automated system, so you MUST respond using the required format:

Do NOT merge lines together in the translation, as this leads to incorrect timings and confusion for the reader.
